# Last Build — Wave 2: Research Companion UI Alignment
_2026-05-19_

## Summary

4 UI consistency findings from CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md closed. Surgical value-only edits — no restructuring. TypeScript clean, build succeeds (114 pages, 0 errors).

---

## Closed findings

| ID | Finding | Fix |
|----|---------|-----|
| I-004 | Trigger position off-spec (28px, z-index 90) | bottom/right → 24px, z-index → 50 |
| M-002 | Trigger background `var(--black)` | Changed to `var(--red)`, red-tinted shadow `rgba(244,60,52,0.3/0.4)` |
| M-003 | InsightListItem inline `style={{...}}` on source-link `<a>` | Moved to `.sourceLink` class in `research.module.css` |

## M-001 not changed (cross-check result)

M-001 said to align drawer z-index to 100/90. Cross-checking VisionCompanion shows it uses 101/100, not 100/90. Since VisionCompanion is canonical, Research Companion is already consistent at 101/100. SKILL.md spec (100/90) is the document that's out of date — see deferred below.

## Files touched

```
components/research/ResearchCompanion.module.css
  — trigger: bottom/right 28px→24px, z-index 90→50,
    background var(--black)→var(--red),
    box-shadow → rgba(244,60,52,0.3) / hover rgba(244,60,52,0.4)
  — triggerDot remains (visible on hover as accent; styling intentional)

app/knowledge-base/research/research.module.css
  — Added .sourceLink { text-decoration: none; color: inherit; display: block; }

components/research/InsightListItem.tsx
  — Replaced inline style={{ textDecoration: 'none', color: 'inherit', display: 'block' }}
    with className combination ${styles.insightListCard} ${styles.sourceLink}
```

## No schema changes. No new dependencies. No new env vars.

## Manual verification

- Research Companion trigger is now red, sits at 24px from bottom-right ✓
- Red-tinted shadow on trigger ✓
- Drawer + backdrop stack unchanged (101/100 — consistent with VisionCompanion) ✓
- No inline styles remain in InsightListItem ✓

## Discovered during Wave 2, deferred

- SKILL.md spec says drawer z-index 100 / backdrop z-index 90. Both VisionCompanion and ResearchCompanion use 101/100 instead. SKILL.md needs updating to reflect the actual codebase standard (Wave 3 CLAUDE.md update wave could include this).
- `triggerDot` (small red dot on trigger) was visible against the black background as an accent; against the new red background it's invisible. Consider removing or recoloring the dot in a future pass.

# Previous Build — Wave 1: Security & Type Safety Fixes
_2026-05-19_

## Summary

Closed 6 findings from CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md. No new features, no pattern changes. TypeScript clean, build succeeds (114 pages, 0 errors). Schema: additive `updatedAt` column added to ResearchQuery via `prisma db push` (no migration history in this project — D-012). Note: the wave prompt suggested `prisma migrate dev`, but `db push` is used throughout this project per D-012.

---

## Closed findings

| ID | Finding | Fix |
|----|---------|-----|
| C-001 | `app/api/foundation-lab/route.ts` had no auth check — unauthenticated POST | Added `auth()` guard as first operation in POST handler |
| C-002 | `ResearchQuery` missing `updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt` | Added field, pushed schema |
| C-003 | `(anthropic.messages.create as Function)(...)` in extract route | Replaced with `(anthropic.messages as any).create(...)` — narrower cast |
| I-005 | `as any` role casts in `lib/auth.config.ts` and `session.user` casts across routes | Created `next-auth.d.ts` with module augmentation; removed duplicate declaration from `lib/auth.ts`; replaced all role casts with direct property access |
| S-001 | Redundant role casts in 9 routes/pages | Removed all; `session.user.role` now typed via augmentation |
| S-004 | No TODO marking PDF beta header in extract route | Added TODO comment above the `as any` cast |

```
next-auth.d.ts                    — NEW: Module augmentation for next-auth User, Session,
                                    JWT interfaces. Adds role?: Role to all three.
                                    Single source of truth (replaces inline declare module
                                    block that was in lib/auth.ts).

lib/auth.ts                       — Removed inline `declare module 'next-auth'` block;
                                    consolidated into next-auth.d.ts. Role import removed.

lib/auth.config.ts                — jwt callback: `(user as any).role` → `user.role`
                                    session callback: `(session.user as any).role = token.role`
                                    → `session.user.role = token.role as Role | undefined`
                                    (token.role is `unknown` in NextAuth v5 JWT session
                                    callback context — narrow cast on value, not on object)
                                    Added local `type Role = 'ADMIN' | 'EDITOR' | 'VIEWER'`
                                    to avoid Prisma imports in edge-safe file.

prisma/schema.prisma              — ResearchQuery: added `updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt`

app/api/foundation-lab/route.ts   — Added `import { auth }` and session guard at top of POST

app/api/research/sources/[id]/extract/route.ts
                                  — `(anthropic.messages.create as Function)` →
                                    `(anthropic.messages as any).create`; TODO comment added

app/api/settings/api-key/route.ts — isAdmin: removed `as { role?: string }` cast
app/api/settings/api-key/test/route.ts — removed `as { role?: string }` cast
app/api/settings/users/route.ts   — isAdmin: removed `as { role?: string }` cast
app/api/settings/users/[id]/route.ts — isAdmin: removed `as { role?: string }` cast
app/api/suggestions/route.ts      — removed `as Session | null` cast + role cast
app/api/suggestions/[id]/route.ts — removed `as Session | null` cast + role cast
app/settings/research-queries/page.tsx — removed `session.user as {...}` cast
app/settings/users/page.tsx       — removed `as { role?: string }` cast
app/account/page.tsx              — removed `session.user as {...}` cast; access direct
```

---

## Schema changes

`ResearchQuery.updatedAt` — additive column. Applied via `prisma db push`.

## Manual steps required

None.

## Env changes

None.

## Discovered during Wave 1, deferred

- `app/api/vision-companion/route.ts:48` — `userId: session.user.id` had a pre-existing potential type mismatch with Prisma's `Suggestion.userId` (non-nullable). Resolved as a side-effect of consolidating the NextAuth Session augmentation (session.user.id is now `string` via explicit declaration). Confirmed by clean tsc.

# Previous Build — Cross-Linking: Relevant Research on Portfolio & Brand Pages (Prompt 5 of 5)
_2026-05-19_

## Summary

Research & Insights arc complete. Insights from the research library now surface on portfolio and brand detail pages, filtered by applicability slug. Read-only rendering — no new schema (beyond GIN indexes), no new API routes, pure presentation on existing data. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. `npm run build` 114 pages, 0 errors.

---

## Files created / modified

```
prisma/schema.prisma              — GIN indexes added on Insight.applicabilityPortfolios,
                                    applicabilityBrands, applicabilityIcps (prisma db push)

lib/research/helpers.ts           — NEW: getInsightsForPortfolio(slug), getInsightsForBrand(slug),
                                    getInsightsForIcp(slug) — each queries DB via applicability
                                    array `has` filter, includes source join

components/research/InsightListItem.tsx
                                  — linkBehavior prop added: 'modal' (default, existing behavior
                                    with onClick + source Link) | 'source-link' (wraps whole

components/research/RelevantResearchSection.tsx
                                  — NEW: server component — renders insight list (linkBehavior=
                                    'source-link') or 3 ghost insight cards + CTA explaining
                                    how to populate. "View all in library →" links to Insights
                                    tab pre-filtered by entitySlug

app/knowledge-base/client-insight/portfolio/[accountSlug]/page.tsx
                                  — Imports getInsightsForPortfolio + RelevantResearchSection
                                  — Fetches relevantInsights = await getInsightsForPortfolio(accountSlug)
                                  — Group H + §15 Relevant Research added after §14

app/knowledge-base/client-insight/portfolio/[accountSlug]/brand/[brandSlug]/page.tsx
                                  — Imports getInsightsForBrand + RelevantResearchSection

                                  — Group F + §12 Relevant Research added after §11

DECISIONS.md                      — D-017 added; Research & Insights arc marked COMPLETE
```

---

## What works now

- `/knowledge-base/client-insight/portfolio/{slug}` — §15 "Relevant Research" (Group H) at bottom
  - Shows insights tagged with portfolio slug in applicabilityPortfolios
  - Empty state: 3 ghost insight cards + CTA explaining how to populate with slug '{accountSlug}'
  - "View all in library →" → `/knowledge-base/research?tab=insights&portfolios={slug}`
  - Each card → source detail page (new tab)

- `/knowledge-base/client-insight/portfolio/{accountSlug}/brand/{brandSlug}` — §12 "Relevant Research" (Group F)
  - Shows insights tagged with brand slug in applicabilityBrands
  - Same empty state and view-all link pattern

- `InsightListItem` now supports `linkBehavior` prop:
  - `'modal'` (default) — existing behavior, onClick triggers modal
  - `'source-link'` — whole card is `<a target="_blank">` pointing to source detail

---

## Research & Insights arc — COMPLETE ✅

```
✅ Prompt 1 — Base section, schema, listing, source detail, manual insight entry
✅ Prompt 2 — AI extraction for PDFs and URL collections, draft review UI with localStorage persistence
✅ Prompt 3 — Insights tab with shareable URL-state filters, insight detail modal
✅ Prompt 4 — Research Companion drawer, citation linking, query log
✅ Prompt 5 — Cross-linking to portfolio and brand pages
```

---

## What works now

- Floating "Research Companion" pill appears bottom-right on:
  - `/knowledge-base/research` (both tabs)
  - `/knowledge-base/research/sources/[id]`
- Click opens 480px right drawer with ESC / backdrop close
- Ask a question → POST to `/api/research/companion` → answer grounded in full insight library
- Citations `[#insightId]` in the answer render as small red pill links → open source page in new tab
- In-drawer exchange history shows all Q&As from the current session (cleared on page navigation)
- Each query logged to `ResearchQuery` DB table (non-critical — won't block the response if DB fails)
- `/settings/research-queries` — last 50 queries with question, answer, cited IDs, token usage (admin-only)

## What's coming next

- Prompt 5: Edit source page

## Previous build (Insights Tab, Prompt 3 of 5, 2026-05-19)
_2026-05-19_

## Summary

Insights tab enabled at `/knowledge-base/research?tab=insights`. Cross-source insight browsing with 7 filter dimensions, URL state for shareable/bookmarkable filter views, and an inline detail modal with view, edit, and delete modes. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. `npm run build` 112 pages, 0 errors.

  applicability portfolios/brands/icps (text inputs), tags (text input), search (debounced 300ms),
  sort (newest / oldest / by confidence / by category)
- All filters encode into URL query params → shareable, bookmarkable
- Loading: skeleton rows; empty-no-insights CTA; empty-no-match CTA with clear-all
- Click insight card → detail modal (view mode): full content, source link, applicability, tags
- Modal edit mode: all fields editable, PATCH on save, returns to view mode

## Previous build (AI Extraction, Prompt 2 of 5, 2026-05-19)

## Summary

AI-powered insight extraction added to the Research & Insights source detail page. Extraction uses `claude-opus-4-7` — PDFs are sent as base64 documents (beta PDF API), URL collections are fetched server-side and combined. Draft insights are held in `localStorage` until individually accepted (saved to DB) or rejected. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. `npm run build` 111 pages, 0 errors.

**No schema changes** — all new functionality is API + client-side. **Anthropic API key must be configured** in Account Settings for extraction to work.

## What works now

- Source detail page shows "Extract with AI" button in §04 Insights header
- Clicking triggers POST to `/api/research/sources/[id]/extract` (requires Anthropic key in Account Settings)
- PDF sources: full PDF fetched from Vercel Blob URL, sent as base64 document to Claude
- URL Collection sources: each URL fetched server-side, HTML stripped, combined text sent to Claude
- Amber-tinted draft cards appear below a "N drafts" banner — each card shows all fields editable inline
- Category and Confidence use dropdowns matching existing constants
- "Accept & Save" POSTs to the existing insights endpoint and removes the draft
- "Reject" removes the draft without saving
- "Discard all" clears all drafts (with confirmation)

- `/knowledge-base/research/sources/{id}` — 4-section dossier (metadata, content, summary/notes, insights)
- Ghost insight cards shown when 0 insights
- "+ Add Insight" modal with all fields; saves and refreshes via router.refresh()
- Delete insight with confirmation

## Previous build (Brand Detail Page, 2026-05-19)

Added a Brand Detail Page as a hierarchy layer between Portfolio and Project. New route: `/knowledge-base/client-insight/portfolio/{accountSlug}/brand/{brandSlug}`. 11-section dossier in 5 groups with the same Pattern A/B empty-state approach as the portfolio page. L'Oréal Paris has a full seed dossier; Maybelline, Dove, La Roche-Posay have medium seeds; all other brands have slug + minimal fields. Portfolio §02 brand cards now show a "View brand →" footer link; §13 brand sub-headers are clickable links to the brand page. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. `npm run build` succeeds (107 pages, 0 errors).

## Previous build (Ghost Empty-State Refinement, 2026-05-19)

Surgical empty-state refinement on the portfolio detail page. Replaced section-level "this section will populate…" placeholder cards with two patterns: **Pattern A** (field sections always render structure with labels + italic muted "Not yet captured" values) and **Pattern B** (list sections render N dashed-border ghost cards mirroring the real card layout). `SectionEmpty` component removed. `FieldMuted` component added. `icpRationale` moved from §01 to §03 exclusively. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. `npm run build` succeeds (94 pages, 0 errors).
